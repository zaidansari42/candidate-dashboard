### What I learned

I learned how CSS Grid comes very much handy in positioning the sections and applying the styles, either if we want a different one. Or want to repeat the same style. and even while building a responsive one, it removes the hassles.

```html
<blockquote>An overall wonderful and rewarding experience</blockquote>
```

```css
section.grid:nth-child(3),
section.grid:nth-child(5) {
  background-color: var(--White);
  color: var(--Very_dark_grayish_blue);
}
```
